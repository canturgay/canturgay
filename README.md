### Hi there 👋🏼

  I am a highly motivated second-year **software engineering** student **@CODE University of Applied Sciences, Berlin**. I also have a **BA in culture management** and **professional experience in film, video, and event production**. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/canturgay/)

  I wrote my first line of code around October 2020, since then I've been learning OOP with **Python**, functional programing with **Javascript**, web development with **Flask, VueJS, HTML, Vanilla JS and CSS**, and relational databases with **MySQL and Postgresql** while utilizing **SQLAlchemy** as ORM. 

  Thanks to the practice based approach of the CODE, all my learnings have been assessed based on the projects I’ve been building rather than mere exams and presentations on isolated subjects. All of the projects (repositories) are directly related to my studies hence “best practices” like agile development, CI/CD, automated testing etc.. were prioritized over end products.
